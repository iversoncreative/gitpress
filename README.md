A Bare-bones Bootstrap WordPress Theme

Please don't laugh... 

This is series of firsts for me: My first attempt at utilizing Github; my first time developing something to share with my fellow designers and developers; my first invitation to collaborate and learn how to be a better developer and professional. Admittedly I don't understand a lot of this at the moment, so please feel free to contribute to this project, complain about anything related to it, politely educate me, or all of the above â€“ I'm open to any of it.

As briefly described, this is a starter theme for WordPress based off Bootstrap. In almost every custom WordPress website I build I start with another starter theme named WordPress Naked (https://code.google.com/p/wordpress-naked/), and I almost always utilize Bootstrap as my framework. In an effort to speed up my process of building custom WordPress themes, I've combined these two resources into what I'm calling GitPress and simultaneously trying to learn how to be a more professional and dedicated developer by diving into Github.
